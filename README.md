## Written Report
In general, your report should follow this basic format:

1. Introduction
2. Exploratory Data Analysis 
3. Results
4. Discussion/Conclusion
5. Appendix (Optional)
6. Bibliography

To complete the project, your group should submit

1. Your written report as a PDF document
2. The .qmd file that, when rendered, creates the self-contained PDF document for the report.
3. Your bibtex references file (and your citation style file, if any citation style file was used)

Even though your report may be written in a Quarto document, and rendered in RStudio, its primary purpose is to be a narrative report that describes how you addressed your research question, not a computer program or a lab notebook with technical details and no context. You should not present tables, figures, or calculations without a written explanation of the information that is supposed to be conveyed by that table or figure.

The PDF file you submit should not display any R code, warnings, or messages. Your technical report should also be well formatted and well organized (e.g., using properly formatted headers to divide sections, using LaTeX markup for mathematical symbols where needed, tables should have bolded column and row labels, etc.). You can use any reasonable citation style (e.g., APA or MLA format), but regardless of style, your bibliography should clearly identify the primary source you are referencing. You should have at least two outside sources cited in your document. 

A typical length is around 2000 words, however, there is no limit/minimum/maximum for the length of the project. Do not worry about being over/under; this number is just for reference.  Although there is no firm word limit, this report is not simply a dump of all the figures, tables, and calculations that you made or considered during this project. You should write enough to clearly communicate what you are doing while still being precise and concise, and keeping the research question in focus. A general rubric for how we will grade the written report is provided [HERE]. The upload links will be on the course Moodle.
