## Written Report
In general, your report should follow this basic format:

1. Introduction
2. Exploratory Data Analysis 
3. Results
4. Discussion/Conclusion
5. Appendix (Optional)
6. Bibliography

To complete the project, your group should submit

1. Your written report as a PDF document
2. The .qmd file that, when rendered, creates the self-contained PDF document for the report.
3. Your bibtex references file (and your citation style file, if any citation style file was used)

Even though your report may be written in a Quarto document, and rendered in RStudio, its primary purpose is to be a narrative report that describes how you addressed your research question, not a computer program or a lab notebook with technical details and no context. You should not present tables, figures, or calculations without a written explanation of the information that is supposed to be conveyed by that table or figure.

The PDF file you submit should not display any R code, warnings, or messages. Your technical report should also be well formatted and well organized (e.g., using properly formatted headers to divide sections, using LaTeX markup for mathematical symbols where needed, tables should have bolded column and row labels, etc.). You can use any reasonable citation style (e.g., APA or MLA format), but regardless of style, your bibliography should clearly identify the primary source you are referencing. You should have at least two outside sources cited in your document. 

A typical length is around 2000 words, however, there is no limit/minimum/maximum for the length of the project. Do not worry about being over/under; this number is just for reference.  Although there is no firm word limit, this report is not simply a dump of all the figures, tables, and calculations that you made or considered during this project. You should write enough to clearly communicate what you are doing while still being precise and concise, and keeping the research question in focus. A general rubric for how we will grade the written report is provided [HERE]. The upload links will be on the course Moodle.


## Written Report Rubric
Below is a rough list of features to look for when judging the quality of the final project report. Each section will be graded out of 5 points, for a total of 25 points: (5) exceptional, (4) very good, (3) satisfactory, (2) below expectations, (1) reasonable attempt.

An exceptional report will typically address all the items in each section. Note, that these items give a rough idea of what we look for. It is possible to check off all items and not receive a 5, it is also possible to miss a few items and get a perfect score. The items listed below are only a guideline to help give you a general idea of what we are looking for when grading. 

### Introduction
1. The topic is clearly explained. 
2. There is an interesting hook to capture the reader. 
3. The research question and goal is clearly stated. 
4. The justification/motivation for the study is articulated well. (i.e. why is it interesting or important?) 
5. The data set used in the study is briefly introduced, and the population is mentioned. If using a pre-made data set, the source is cited. If collecting data, some collection details are briefly mentioned. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
1. If you did a survey, the sample questions are provided. 
2. Describe how the data was collected.  (It is totally okay to not have a perfect sample/data set! Do not hide that, just be clear on how the data was collected). 
3. Important wrangling steps are explained.  For example, removing missing values, re-coding variables, etc. 
4. The number of total observations and variables studied is clear. 
5. The units of measurement are included. 
6. The distribution of each variable studied is presented. 
7. Important relationships between variables are explored.
8. Tables and figures are sufficiently explained, and have captions. 
9. All figure and table captions are succinct and useful (not overly redundant). 

### Results 
1. The type of test being used is clear. 
2. Assumptions are investigated. 
3. The hypothesis test has a clear connection to the research question. 
4. The test statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom, confidence interval, and significance level are explained/provided. (Only some of these will be applicable for each project)
5. For confidence intervals: corresponding interpretations are provided. 
6. For linear regression models: coefficients are interpreted. 
7. Explain any statistics or figures used for the hypothesis test. 
8. Results are interpreted correctly and in context. 

### Discussion 
1. A summary of your overall findings are explained in a clear and straightforward manner such that a person without statistical training or domain expertise can understand them.
2. Results are tied back to the research question. 
3. Limitations of the analysis/data are acknowledged. 
4. It is explained/assessed if the sample is representative of your population of interest. (Hint: Most samples have some limitations.  It is okay to have a sample that is not perfect, but you must be able to identify why the sample may not represent the population.) 
5. Discussion of future directions or extensions to this project you want to consider.

### Writing Style 
1. Overall throughout the report, the ideas expressed precisely and concisely.
2. Overall throughout the report, the writing and exposition are geared towards someone with a similar level of statistical training (e.g., the writing doesn’t rely heavily on jargon, but also doesn’t elaborate on minute details that don’t benefit the reader's understanding of the research).
3. The report includes at least two outside sources, using appropriate in-text citations and a formatted bibliography. 
4. The R code is hidden from the reader, and is the report free from messages, warning messages, and error messages. 
5. The output from your R code appropriately styled (i.e., are tables formatted as tables) and is the report free from ’random’ outputs (e.g., a p-value being printed out in the middle of a paragraph)
